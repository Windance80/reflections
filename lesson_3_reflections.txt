Syntax:
$ git remote 	
	# To view the current remote
$ git remote add "name" "url" 
	# To add Github repo as a remote on local
	# "name" is origin if only have one remote
	# "url" is from Github web
$ git remote -v 
	# More info on remote

$ git push "remote_name" "branch_name"
	# Copy all the commits reachable from "branch_name" to "remote_name"
	# "remote_name", github repository
	
Reflections:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When doing a project that shared with others
