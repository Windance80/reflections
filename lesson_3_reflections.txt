Reflections:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When doing a project that shared with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the change made it local repository might get lost

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	clones: clone the repository from the github
	branches: branches track the commit
	forks: clone the repository to github
		use clones when cloning the repository into local
		use branches when adding a new feature or making a different version
		use forks when changing another repository on github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	To keep track if the online repository has been change through git fetch "remote_name"

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Using Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox. I imagined it's hard to keep track what changes without Git or GitHub

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	When I want to add features, or I wanna change things without impacting master, the benefits is that I can checkout my main version back to where it was.
